# Template Base

> Records the upstream template lineage for this ordinary derived project. Do not use this file for domain-template inheritance metadata.

- Lineage type: ordinary derived project
- Template repository: github.com/emily8421/ai-project-template
- Base template version: v1.54.2
- Current synced template version: v1.64.0
- Synced at: 2026-08-18
- Project version file: VERSION
- Project version at sync time: v0.1.0

## Version Semantics

- `VERSION` is owned by this derived project and records the project version.
- `CHANGELOG.md` and `CHANGELOG-PLAIN.md` are owned by this derived project and record project evolution; template sync does not overwrite them.
- `TEMPLATE-BASE.md` records the inherited ai-project-template version used for methodology sync audit.
- `upstream/CHANGELOG.md` and `upstream/CHANGELOG-PLAIN.md` are generated read-only references for upstream ai-project-template release notes.
- Template sync commits keep the message format `sync template v1.64.0 from ai-project-template`.

## Managed Files

- Files managed by template sync are listed in `template-sync.json` (synced from ai-project-template).
- Direct edits to those files are overwritten on the next template sync; propose reusable changes via `_proposals/`.
- Project-owned files (`ai/project-rules.md`, `docs/`, business code) are not in the sync list and are preserved.
